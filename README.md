## 🚀 What is NodePilot?

**NodePilot** is a web-based control panel for managing and monitoring JavaScript (Node.js) scripts with a clean, dark-themed user interface. It was designed to simplify script operations such as:

- ✅ Secure script launching and stopping
- ✅ Real-time console output and monitoring
- ✅ Clear visibility into script status (Online/Offline)
- ✅ Multi-version Node.js support (switch between versions like 16.x, 21.x, 22.x)
- ✅ User authentication for protected actions
- ✅ Lightweight, PHP-based backend with minimal setup

NodePilot is ideal for developers, teams, and sysadmins who need an easy way to manage Node.js services without using a full container or orchestration system.
